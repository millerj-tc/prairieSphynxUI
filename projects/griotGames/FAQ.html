<i>So what's the point of this?</i><br>
Basically, you're trying to figure out which roster is the most likely to win against any other roster.<br><br>

<i>I'm overwhelmed! Where do I start?</i><br>
Just try changing some characters around and see what happens. Notice which characters seem to win more. The output gives you clues about how the underlying simulation works and how the characters operate within the simulation.<br><br>
    
<i>I'm still overwhelmed! I feel like I won't ever figure this out</i><br>
That's okay! You definitely don't need to fully solve the simulation, you just need your best guess to be better than everyone else who submits for the tournament. Trying to fully solve the simulation will be pretty hard, so seeing how well you do relative to other people in the tournament is the main idea.<br><br>
        
<i>I see the submission deadline is days away -- do I really need to put multiple days into this??</i><br>
Not at all! The long submission deadline is for two reasons:

<br><br> - To help people participate who want to work on it a little bit each day over a few days
<br> -  To give time to people who want to solve the extra hard puzzle(s) that you can access after submitting a guess for the initial puzzle.
<br><br>
    
<i>Okay, I've got it, you take the alphanumeric value of the character's first name, multiply by 3, then take the square root of that....</i><br>
I love the enthusiasm, but no. There is nothing mathematically complex happening in the simulation. Every mechanic is based on comparing two numbers to see which is bigger or simple addition/subtraction. Don't waste your time with anything more complex than that.<br><br>

<i>Why does the simulator allow duplicate characters across teams but not on the same team?</i><br>
Good question! When you submit your roster, someone you're competing against may have submitted some of the same characters.<br><br>

<i>Can I save/load results?</i><br>
Not yet, hopefully next time. Taking notes is allowed :)<br><br>

<i>How does my solution compete with the solutions of other players?</i><br>
All the solutions are put in a round robin and compared against each other and then will be ranked by win %.<br><br>

<i>What if I find a bug in the simulation?</i><br>
<a href="https://forms.gle/2FUBfhy3unURsdRH8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">You can submit it here!</a> There is a separate contest for who can find the most bugs. Typos in the output text do not count as bugs for the purposes of the contest but you should still let me know :P<br><br>
